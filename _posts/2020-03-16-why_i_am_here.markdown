          Ever since I was a little boy, I have been fasinated with the world, whether it be man made or nature I would always take in everything I could. When I was just 5 years old my mother took my sister and I to our first roller coaster ride, its named "The Giant Dipper" it was at the time an 80 year old (now 96) wooden ride. My mom let my sister and I go by our selves, and had her Poleroid camera getting pictures of my sister and I in the front of the coaster. My sister, being the diva she was, was smiling and looking at the camera in every picture, while you can see me in the background looking down fascinated trying to figure out how the hell this new machine to me works. you may think being 5 years old how could i remember what was going on? well not even 5 hours later I took it upon myself to build my own rollercoaster, using only a plastic flinstone type car i had and my parents carpeted stairs..... yeah, I really did that. one face rug burn later, I started my life of engineering.  Ever since then I have made hundreds of different gadgets and gizmos as a kid, from fan powered boats, to rocket powered lego cars, to me getting older and always finding an out of the box solution to almost any problem I had. 
					because of all that, my mom had told me my entire life that I should become an engineer, but the only issue that I had was that I could never choose, between software, mechanical, structural, ect. I wanted to do them all, not just one. 
					
				So I recently decided what I wanted to do, I want to work with someone whom does it all, and who better then Elon Musk, I will get finished with this course in the next 5 months, I will do anything it takes to work with Tesla / Space X, and I will become the all around Inventor / Engineer that I always knew I should be.
